# Car Value Evaluation Model
 
 # 1.Introduction
The global used car market is valued at over $1 trillion. My project aims to provide clarity and direction in this market by evaluating car values using a dataset that grades cars based on various attributes.


2. Dataset Description
I chose the [Car Evaluation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation) for its comprehensive information on buying price, tech, safety, size, and more. The dataset contains 1727 rows and 7 columns.


3. Distribution and Potential Challenges
The dataset presents challenges such as categorical data and potential class imbalance. Addressing these challenges is crucial for accurate model predictions.


4. Methodology
My methodology involves careful data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and normalizing data. I then selected and trained two models - decision trees and neural networks - to evaluate car values.

5. Implementation
For detailed implementation, refer to the attached IPYNB file.

6. Results and Analysis
The Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of 98.15%, while the MLP Neural Network model achieved 97.45%. Comparative analysis shows the strengths and potential areas of improvement for each model.

7. Insights and Possible Improvement
Both models performed well, but different encoding techniques for categorical data and feature engineering could further enhance accuracy.
